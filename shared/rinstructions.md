### SETUP: before the first tutorial


1. FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE BASICS OF GIT AND GITHUB AND START YOUR OWN REPO FOR USE IN THIS CLASS SO THAT YOUR WORK IN CLASS IS NOT LOST  

Throughout the course we will be using a version control method so that you can access your work from any computer that's online and keep track of the changes you introduced, and revert if you make a serious mistake. For this purpose, we will be using GitHub.

Before the tutorial,  start a new private repo for your use in the course (call it any way you like).  Don't worry about cloning it yet, you will clone it and we will set up your initial project folder in class.

If you are not familiar with it, please watch these short tutorials:

If git (the local software you need to use github) is not available on your machine, follow these links to install it:

https://git-scm.com/downloads
https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200532077

And if you prefer to read about creating a new repo:

2.  WE WILL BE USING PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE R, AND RSTUDIO IN CLASS. FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE BASICS OF THESE BEFORE COMING TO THE FIRST TUTORIAL

2A.  Watch these introductory tutorials

    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY8BISK5DpM
    
2B. If you plan to work from home on your own computer, install R and Rstudio. Computers in the tutorial laboratory have them installed. There are some additional packages and requirements that we use. Instructions for their installation are available HERE [LINK]. If you don't understand them at this point, don't worry, we'll sort it out later on. If you do, feel free to use them to install the libraries. 

2C. Read Chapter Three of Kruschke's book [LINK]

2D. Go through some basic practice in R by using swirl. That is, choose short course:

        1: R Programming: The basics of programming in R

using the swirl library.  See:

https://swirlstats.com/students.html

for installation and instructions (it's best to type in the terminal at the bottom of Rstudio when using swirl).
