### SETUP: before the first tutorial


<b> 1. Familiarize yourself with the basics of Git and github, start your own repository for use in the class so that your work is not </b>

Throughout the course we will be using a version control method so that you can access your work from any computer, as the data are stored in the cloud. It allows  you to that's online and keep track of the changes you introduced, and revert if you make a serious mistake. For this purpose, we will be using the most popular tool for this purpose---GitHub.

Before the tutorial,  start a new private repo for your use in the course (call it any way you like).  Don't worry about cloning it yet, you will clone it and we will set up your initial project folder in class.

If you are not familiar with it, please watch these short tutorials:

<b>2.2 If you plan to work from home on your own computer, install R and Rstudio. Computers in the tutorial laboratory have them installed. There are some additional packages and requirements that we use. Instructions for their installation are available HERE [LINK]. If you don't understand them at this point, don't worry, we'll sort it out later on. If you do, feel free to use them to install the libraries. </b>

<b>2.3 Read Chapter Three of Kruschke's book [LINK] </b>

<b> 2.4 Go through some basic practice in R by using swirl, as practice is the best way to learn programming. That is, choose short course: </b>

        1: R Programming: The basics of programming in R

using the swirl library.  See:  

    https://swirlstats.com/students.html



for installation and instructions (it's best to type in the terminal at the bottom of Rstudio when using swirl).
